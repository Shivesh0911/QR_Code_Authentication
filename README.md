# QR Code Authentication: Detecting Original vs. Counterfeit Prints  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on classifying QR codes as **original (first print)** or **counterfeit (second print)** using **Machine Learning and Deep Learning** techniques. The dataset consists of QR codes with embedded **Copy Detection Patterns (CDPs)**, where counterfeit versions are generated by scanning and reprinting originals.


## 🚀 Features  
✔ **Data Preprocessing:** Converts QR images to grayscale, resizes, and normalizes them.  
✔ **Feature Engineering:** Extracts key features such as texture, edge detection, and CDP patterns.  
✔ **Model Training:** Implements both **traditional ML (SVM, Random Forest)** and **CNN-based deep learning**.  
✔ **Evaluation:** Uses Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix for model assessment.  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset contains two categories:  
- **First Prints:** Authentic QR codes.  
- **Second Prints:** Scanned and reprinted (counterfeit) QR codes.
